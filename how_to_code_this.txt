1. Set Up Your Project Structure:

Create a directory for your project and organize it like this:

lua

project_directory/
|-- pokemon_environment.py
|-- dqn_model.py
|-- dqn_agent.py
|-- train.py
|-- your_rom.gb

2. Populate the ROM File:

Place your Game Boy ROM file (e.g., your_rom.gb) in the project directory.
3. Implement Game Environment (pokemon_environment.py):

Fill in the methods in pokemon_environment.py to handle the game environment, observations, rewards, etc.
4. Implement DQN Model (dqn_model.py):

Fill in the DQNModel class in dqn_model.py with your specific model architecture.
5. Implement DQN Agent (dqn_agent.py):

Fill in the DQNAgent class in dqn_agent.py with your specific agent logic.
6. Implement Training Script (train.py):

Fill in the training script train.py with your training logic. Update the paths and hyperparameters as needed.
7. Run Training:

Run the training script from the command line or your preferred Python environment:

bash

python train.py

This will execute the training loop for the specified number of episodes, and the agent will learn to play the game based on the provided DQN architecture.
Important Notes:

    Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
    Install the necessary dependencies, including pyboy and torch. You can install them using pip install pyboy torch.
    Ensure your ROM file is compatible with the pyboy emulator.
    Adjust the code based on your specific game and requirements. For instance, modify the observation space, action space, and reward logic accordingly.

Feel free to ask if you encounter any issues or need further clarification on any part of the code!
